<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Photovoltaic Mounts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tracking Mount</li><li>Fixed Mount</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solar photovoltaic mounts market consists of two primary types: tracking mounts and fixed mounts. Tracking mounts adjust the position of solar panels throughout the day to follow the sunâ€™s path, maximizing energy capture and increasing efficiency. In contrast, fixed mounts have a stationary design, securely positioning solar panels at a predetermined angle. While tracking mounts typically offer higher energy output, fixed mounts are often more cost-effective and simpler to install, making them suitable for various installation scenarios.</p></p>
