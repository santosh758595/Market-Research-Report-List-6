<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The VR and AR Optics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Waveguide</li><li>Lens</li></ul></p>
<p><p>VR and AR optics market consists of two main types: waveguide and lens. Waveguide technology uses a transparent glass or plastic panel to guide light from a small projector into the user’s eyes, creating a virtual image. Lens technology, on the other hand, uses curved glass or plastic lenses to bend and focus light, allowing users to see virtual objects overlaying the real world. Both waveguide and lens technologies are essential components in creating immersive and realistic virtual and augmented reality experiences.</p></p>
