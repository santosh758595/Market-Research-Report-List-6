<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Output Monitoring Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-invasive</li><li>Minimally Invasive</li><li>Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiac output monitoring devices are categorized into three primary types based on their invasiveness. Non-invasive devices, such as Doppler ultrasound and bioimpedance, measure cardiac output without penetrating the body, providing real-time data with minimal discomfort. Minimally invasive devices, like pulmonary artery catheters, require small insertions to gather accurate hemodynamic data while reducing risks. Invasive devices, such as direct arterial or central venous pressure monitors, provide continuous, precise measurements but involve higher risks due to their invasive nature. These devices are essential for critical care and surgical settings.</p></p>
