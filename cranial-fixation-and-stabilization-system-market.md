<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cranial Fixation and Stabilization System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nonresorbable</li><li>Resorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Cranial Fixation and Stabilization System market encompasses two main types: nonresorbable and resorbable materials. Nonresorbable systems, typically made from materials like titanium, provide long-lasting support during neurosurgical procedures and are not absorbed by the body. In contrast, resorbable systems utilize materials that gradually dissolve over time, eliminating the need for a second surgery and reducing long-term complications. Both types are crucial for maintaining cranial stability and supporting the healing process following surgical interventions.</p></p>
