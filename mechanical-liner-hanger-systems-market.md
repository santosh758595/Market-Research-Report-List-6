<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Liner Hanger Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotating Type</li><li>Non-Rotating Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mechanical liner hanger systems are used in the oil and gas industry to suspend and seal off a liner in a wellbore. There are two main types of liner hanger systems: rotating type and non-rotating type. In rotating type systems, the liner can be rotated independently of the hanger, allowing for easier installation and alignment. Non-rotating type systems do not have this feature and require the liner to be aligned before installation. Both types have their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the wellbore.</p></p>
