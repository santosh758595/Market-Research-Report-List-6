<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hard CMP Pads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Abrasive Type</li><li>Normal Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hard CMP pads can be categorized into two main market types based on their composition: Abrasive Type and Normal Type. Abrasive Type pads are designed with added abrasive materials to improve material removal rates during the polishing process. On the other hand, Normal Type pads are made without abrasive materials and are used for precise, fine polishing applications. Both types of pads cater to different needs in the semiconductor industry, with Abrasive Type pads being ideal for high removal rate polishing and Normal Type pads for fine polishing.</p></p>
