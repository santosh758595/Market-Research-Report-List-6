<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non invasive Glucose Monitoring System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wearable Devices</li><li>Non-wearable Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-invasive glucose monitoring systems are available in two main types: wearable devices and non-wearable devices. Wearable devices are typically worn on the body and continuously monitor glucose levels through sensors, making it convenient for users to track their levels throughout the day. Non-wearable devices, on the other hand, are usually used intermittently and do not require direct contact with the body. Both types of devices provide a more comfortable and convenient option for monitoring glucose levels compared to traditional invasive methods.</p></p>
