<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Atrial Fibrillation Treatment Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Catheter Ablation</li><li>Maze Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Atrial Fibrillation (AF) treatment device market encompasses various types, primarily including catheter ablation and maze surgery. Catheter ablation involves inserting catheters into the heart to target and destroy aberrant electrical pathways causing AF, offering a minimally invasive solution. Maze surgery, in contrast, is a more invasive procedure that creates scar tissue in a precise pattern in the heart, disrupting unwanted electrical signals. Both methods aim to restore normal heart rhythm, enhancing patient outcomes in AF management.</p></p>
