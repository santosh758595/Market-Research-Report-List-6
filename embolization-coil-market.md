<p><strong>The Embolization Coil Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Arterial Vessel Embolization</li><li>Venous Vessel Embolization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The embolization coil market encompasses applications for both arterial and venous vessel embolization. In arterial vessel embolization, coils are used to block blood flow to specific areas, such as tumors or abnormal blood vessels, enhancing surgical precision and reducing blood loss. Conversely, venous vessel embolization involves occluding veins to treat conditions like varicose veins or venous malformations. Both applications leverage advanced coil designs for effective vessel occlusion, improving patient outcomes and allowing for less invasive treatment options in vascular interventions.</p></p>
