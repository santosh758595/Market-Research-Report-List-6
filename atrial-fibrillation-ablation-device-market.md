<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Catheter Ablation</li><li>Maze Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Device market includes two primary types: catheter ablation and maze surgery. Catheter ablation involves inserting thin tubes into the heart to destroy abnormal electrical pathways with energy, thereby restoring normal rhythm. This minimally invasive technique is widely used due to its effectiveness and shorter recovery time. In contrast, maze surgery is a more invasive procedure where incisions are made in the heart to create scar tissue that blocks irregular signals, often reserved for complex cases or patients with other heart issues.</p></p>
